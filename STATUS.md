# meowy project status

Updated: 2026-09-15. This is the current project handoff; Git retains prior work.
[COMPILER.md](COMPILER.md) holds the implementation plan and
[compiler/STATUS.md](compiler/STATUS.md) the detailed compiler handoff.
Do not recreate STEP logs. The full documented v0.0.1 release remains incomplete.

## Documentation conventions

Write the project name as `meowy`. Reader examples follow
[the documentation conventions](docs/guide/documentation-style.md), including
linked standalone examples. Tests, internal tooling and generated source retain
independent layouts. Explicit compact-syntax demonstrations and exact identifiers,
protocol bytes, output text and reference fixtures remain preserved.

Documentation and 82 standalone examples retain the standardized readable layout.
The prior token/literal preservation audit is `/tmp/meowy-doc-style-audit.json`;
Git preserves its completed commit series. Compiler guides remain in `compiler/docs/`.

## Current milestone

The logical ledger now charges type materialization, evaluated required statements
and blocks, selected integer/boolean evaluation, and scalar/record projection
paths. Required type literals, aliases and annotations now charge source nodes
before normalization, retaining duplicate inputs and work before errors. Type
literals, reads, queries and subtraction also charge expression steps;
grouping and synthetic wrappers add no logical construction costs. Required record
construction and recursive copies now charge aggregate slots; composition transfers
charged slots without duplication. Retained record reads charge without replaying
initializer work. Ordinary list extents now have isolated logical roots while
preserving their constant-input restrictions.
Nested roots retain original spans
and sticky failures; grouping, form checks and skipped branches spend no evaluation
steps. Other accounting domains and proof evaluation remain incomplete.

The partial proof package now exposes typed revision metadata and opaque descriptor
type aliases through local bindings and file facades. Type-only copy queries now
retain pending metadata and fixed Result signatures until ordinary typing and
ownership checks finish, then fail B001 before code generation. Evaluated results,
observations and assertions remain unimplemented.

Bounded `!<U>` subtraction now constructs normalized concrete type sets in annotations,
aliases and required expressions. Static queries, imported values and bare type blocks
retain identity, original failures and work. Removing all members produces `never`;
both operands are still evaluated. Subtraction does not validate nullable runtime data.

Commits: `bc3030c` (parser), `ae68e3b` (evaluator), `e5579d3` (integration).
The [guide](compiler/docs/COMPUTED_TYPES.md#type-subtraction) covers syntax, budgets
and remaining limits. Its example prints `7` in debug/release. The full compiler gate
passes. Mixed adjacent union suffixes, literal subtypes and broad bases remain gated.

Required type equality, including bare type blocks, remains supported with scoped
inference and scalar-context checks. No runtime type storage is created.

Named immutable `core.Type` exports continue to retain concrete payloads through
explicit facades. Private names, separate namespaces and module startup stay intact.
The compiler entry guide is [compiler/README.md](compiler/README.md); detailed guides
live in `compiler/docs/`.

Net/HTTP/TLS still needs broader generic-type/I/O/task foundations. Full v0.0.1
release qualification remains incomplete.

The first executable proof series is now planned: bounded type-only copy queries,
static descriptors and assertions. Phase/dependency tracking and logical root
accounting must precede query execution. Partial module/revision metadata and
direct required reads pass focused checker/native tests and the full compiler gate.
Proof evaluation remains unimplemented. Opaque descriptor type aliases now preserve nominal identities
and reject runtime storage; the final compiler gate passes.
Pending query copies retain source origins without runtime storage. The next
prerequisite is remaining type-expression and logical-root accounting; query outcomes
remain gated.

## Actual validation

- `python3 -B tools/verify.py --compiler`: all ten checks passed, including 929
  library/889 native tests (1818 total), 20 Python tests, fmt, Clippy, build, links
  and catalog/schema checks. Conformance: 10 passed, 13 unsupported, 0 failed in
  debug/release. Log: `/tmp/meowy-extent-roots-gate.log`.
- Four extent-root checker groups and two native groups cover independent resets,
  shared required budgets, exact/overflow limits, grouping, constant/proof input
  separation, mode/reach restoration, capacities, runtime-skipped checks and
  original imported errors. Native programs and rejection checks pass in both
  profiles. Logs: `/tmp/meowy-extent-roots-library.log`,
  `/tmp/meowy-extent-roots-integration.log`.
- Logical E220 boundaries are tested internally; bootstrap B001 guards remain
  separate. Ordinary type-constructor roots, text/helper counters and pending-query
  budget retention remain open. Proof outcomes stay gated; unsupported queries
  are not conformance successes.
- Runtime implementation, reference fixtures, dependencies and versions are
  unchanged. Editor and separate runtime/sanitizer gates were not rerun.
  Full v0.0.1 release qualification remains incomplete.

## Area handoff

| Area | Current boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Compiler | Logical charges cover type-expression dispatch/materialization, required statements/blocks, scalar/record reads and constructed/copied record slots; remaining root domains and query budgets stay open. |
| Documentation tooling | Constructed signatures and file graphs are checked; multi-file doc commands/indexes remain separate. |
| Editor integration | Pointer syntax previously passed Vim/Neovim; unchanged here. |
| Standard library | `proof` revision 1 specifies queries and static tests; implementation remains open. Net/HTTP foundations remain separate. |
| Runtime and release | File-site runtime helpers passed native probes; platform/distribution qualification remains open. |

## Proof package reference

The [proof reference](docs/reference/stdlib/proof.md) specifies revision 1: opaque
compile-time results, value/range queries, type capabilities, immediate ownership
probes, snapshot rules, a canonical bounded analysis and strict phase separation.
`assert` requires Always; `expect<S>` tests any exact result, including Indeterminable.
The testing section covers compile-only contracts and negative diagnostics, alongside
a qualification matrix. E223/E224/E225 are registered in the diagnostic catalog.

Commits: `12d21df` (results/value APIs), `415f7c4` (ownership/canonical analysis),
`947c56b` (testing, work accounting, qualification and cross-links).
The docs, library index, compile-time rules, testing and memory APIs link the contract.
Default repository verification and whitespace checks pass. The query APIs, observation
parameter mode, proof-only descriptor unions and executable proof fixtures are not
implemented; no runtime/compile-time execution of proof examples was claimed.

## Release naming

[VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) defines the project release policy: keep major/minor
at zero, use the patch field as a chosen release identifier, make releases without a
fixed cadence, and label pre-releases as uncertain. Numbers do not promise compatibility
or chronological order. The existing full-release target remains an implementation
milestone, and protocol/schema/contract revision rules remain independent.
README and COMPILER link this policy. No package version or release tag was changed.
All four default repository checks pass, including 16 tooling tests, local links,
catalog metadata and schemas. Log: `/tmp/meowy-versioning-docs.log`. Compiler/runtime
execution was not part of this documentation edit.

## Next steps

1. Define ordinary type-construction roots in `check/names.rs` and `check/exports.rs`
   without charging lookup probes or broadening initializer eligibility. Ordinary
   list extents now have isolated roots; enclosing constructor boundaries and mode
   propagation remain open. The [compiler handoff](compiler/STATUS.md#executable-proof-plan)
   records the next accounting, text/helper and deferred-query work. Proof outcomes
   and flags remain gated.

2. Broaden subtraction only after its remaining syntax/representation prerequisites
   are established. Do not push, bump versions or claim full release qualification.
