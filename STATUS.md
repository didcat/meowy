# meowy project status

Updated: 2026-09-13. This is the current project handoff; Git retains prior work.
[COMPILER.md](COMPILER.md) holds the implementation plan and
[compiler/STATUS.md](compiler/STATUS.md) the detailed compiler handoff.
Do not recreate STEP logs. The full documented v0.0.1 release remains incomplete.

## Documentation conventions

Write the project name as `meowy`. Reader examples follow
[the documentation conventions](docs/guide/documentation-style.md), including
linked standalone examples. Tests, internal tooling and generated source retain
independent layouts. Explicit compact-syntax demonstrations and exact identifiers,
protocol bytes, output text and reference fixtures remain preserved.

Documentation and 82 standalone examples retain the standardized readable layout.
The prior token/literal preservation audit is `/tmp/meowy-doc-style-audit.json`;
Git preserves its completed commit series. Compiler guides remain in `compiler/docs/`.

## Current milestone

The partial proof package now exposes typed revision metadata and opaque descriptor
type aliases through local bindings and file facades. Result values, observations
and assertions remain unimplemented.

Bounded `!<U>` subtraction now constructs normalized concrete type sets in annotations,
aliases and required expressions. Static queries, imported values and bare type blocks
retain identity, original failures and work. Removing all members produces `never`;
both operands are still evaluated. Subtraction does not validate nullable runtime data.

Commits: `bc3030c` (parser), `ae68e3b` (evaluator), `e5579d3` (integration).
The [guide](compiler/docs/COMPUTED_TYPES.md#type-subtraction) covers syntax, budgets
and remaining limits. Its example prints `7` in debug/release. The full compiler gate
passes. Mixed adjacent union suffixes, literal subtypes and broad bases remain gated.

Required type equality, including bare type blocks, remains supported with scoped
inference and scalar-context checks. No runtime type storage is created.

Named immutable `core.Type` exports continue to retain concrete payloads through
explicit facades. Private names, separate namespaces and module startup stay intact.
The compiler entry guide is [compiler/README.md](compiler/README.md); detailed guides
live in `compiler/docs/`.

Net/HTTP/TLS still needs broader generic-type/I/O/task foundations. Full v0.0.1
release qualification remains incomplete.

The first executable proof series is now planned: bounded type-only copy queries,
static descriptors and assertions. Phase/dependency tracking and logical root
accounting must precede query execution. Partial module/revision metadata and
direct required reads pass focused checker/native tests and the full compiler gate. Proof queries remain
unimplemented. Opaque descriptor type aliases now preserve nominal identities
and reject runtime storage; the final compiler gate passes.
Result values and deferred obligations remain the next implementation work.

## Actual validation

- `python3 -B tools/verify.py --compiler`: all ten checks passed, including 852
  library/875 native tests (1727 total), 20 Python tests, fmt, Clippy, build, links
  and catalog/schema checks. Conformance: 10 passed, 13 unsupported, 0 failed in
  debug/release. Log: `/tmp/meowy-proof-descriptor-gate.log`.
- Five proof checker groups and four native groups cover revision identity/reads,
  descriptor aliases, runtime storage rejection, zero-HIR unused metadata, scope,
  file facades/privacy and rendered documentation.
  Focused log: `/tmp/meowy-proof-descriptor-integration.log`.
- The foundation guide example prints `1` and `7` in debug/release.
  Extracted source: `/tmp/meowy-proof-revision-guide.mwy`. Documentation links
  pass in the final gate. The descriptor alias guide passes `check` in debug/release;
  source: `/tmp/meowy-proof-descriptor-guide.mwy`.
- Proof queries and constructed result values are unimplemented; no proof analysis
  fixture passed.
  Runtime implementation, reference fixtures, dependencies and versions are
  unchanged. Editor and separate runtime/sanitizer gates were not rerun.
  Full v0.0.1 release qualification remains incomplete.

## Area handoff

| Area | Current boundary |
| --- | --- |
| Compiler | Proof revision metadata and opaque descriptor type aliases are implemented; queries remain gated. |
| Documentation tooling | Constructed signatures and file graphs are checked; multi-file doc commands/indexes remain separate. |
| Editor integration | Pointer syntax previously passed Vim/Neovim; unchanged here. |
| Standard library | `proof` revision 1 specifies queries and static tests; implementation remains open. Net/HTTP foundations remain separate. |
| Runtime and release | File-site runtime helpers passed native probes; platform/distribution qualification remains open. |

## Proof package reference

The [proof reference](docs/reference/stdlib/proof.md) specifies revision 1: opaque
compile-time results, value/range queries, type capabilities, immediate ownership
probes, snapshot rules, a canonical bounded analysis and strict phase separation.
`assert` requires Always; `expect<S>` tests any exact result, including Indeterminable.
The testing section covers compile-only contracts and negative diagnostics, alongside
a qualification matrix. E223/E224/E225 are registered in the diagnostic catalog.

Commits: `12d21df` (results/value APIs), `415f7c4` (ownership/canonical analysis),
`947c56b` (testing, work accounting, qualification and cross-links).
The docs, library index, compile-time rules, testing and memory APIs link the contract.
Default repository verification and whitespace checks pass. The query APIs, observation
parameter mode, proof-only descriptor unions and executable proof fixtures are not
implemented; no runtime/compile-time execution of proof examples was claimed.

## Release naming

[VERSIONING.md](VERSIONING.md) defines the project release policy: keep major/minor
at zero, use the patch field as a chosen release identifier, make releases without a
fixed cadence, and label pre-releases as uncertain. Numbers do not promise compatibility
or chronological order. The existing full-release target remains an implementation
milestone, and protocol/schema/contract revision rules remain independent.
README and COMPILER link this policy. No package version or release tag was changed.
All four default repository checks pass, including 16 tooling tests, local links,
catalog metadata and schemas. Log: `/tmp/meowy-versioning-docs.log`. Compiler/runtime
execution was not part of this documentation edit.

## Next steps

1. Continue proof result metadata beyond the completed descriptor type aliases:
   fixed declared types, active alternatives and retained origins, tied to deferred
   obligations. Queries remain gated. The
   [compiler handoff](compiler/STATUS.md#executable-proof-plan) records the ordered
   descriptor, accounting, phase/dependency and type-only query slices.
2. Broaden subtraction only after its remaining syntax/representation prerequisites
   are established. Do not push, bump versions or claim full release qualification.
